console.log(this);


//# this will give us output as scopes ({})..

//* but if we will do the same thing in console in browser then this will give us window object which is a global context.....

//# We dont have to go deep in this as of now just we have to know that this keyword exist,,,and this keyword gives us the access to the global context.... in node it give me a empty scope({})...and when we go to browser it gives us access to window object.....
