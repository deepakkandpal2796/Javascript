//? in javaScript we have so many types of values to store and to store them we have so many variables ...... var, let, const.....
//! var ==> is a variable which we can change ahead.
//! const ==> is a variable which cant be changes if once stored.
//! let ==> we will discuss ahead.

var fullName = 'Deepak kandpal'; // string.
var isLoggedIn, courseName, loginTime; // declaring variables in a line.
isLoggedIn = false; //boolean varable.
courseName = 'Javascript';
console.log(fullName);
console.log(isLoggedIn);
console.log(courseName);
console.log(loginTime); //! loginTime is undefined
//similarly you can store rest of the variable such as integer and float.

//# so basically we can store numbers, strings, boolean, and if we store nothing its undefined..there are some reserve keyword which we cant use like if, function ............these are not used as variable name..
